With the power of Flutter, Appwrite, and this app, you can easily host your Encrypted chat system in a few simple steps. No more fear of being snooped on, since you have all the control over your messages that are secured using a private key - and an even more awesome thing is that it's open-source so you can modify it to make it however you want it to be. The encryption is based on public-private key pairs where the private key is generated on the device and you can keep a backup of it using a QR code generated inside the app, which makes switching devices easy without data loss. The theme is based on Appwrite's website - and everything else is just CUTE AND SECURE.

# Setup Instructions &nbsp; <img src="./resources/computer.png" height="30" align="justify"/>

## Appwrite Installation
- Follow the steps mentioned on the official appwrite website for [instllation](https://appwrite.io/docs/installation) with docker
- In the directory where you ran the docker command, you will find a `.env` file
- Edit that file, find `_APP_FUNCTIONS_ENVS` and set it's value to `dart-2.16`
- Also delete the `_APP_FUNCTIONS_ENVS` field - Save the file
- In the same directory open a terminal or cmd and run the following command
```
docker-compose up -d
```
- This completes the docker setup

## Project Setup &nbsp; <img src="./resources/project_icon.png" height="30" align="justify"/>
- Open a browser and go to the `localhost:80` or if you set some other port
- Signup and remember the credentials - you will need them
- Create a new Project as shown below `Keep the project id as ecat` unless you want to rebuild your application.

![screenshot](./resources/registration.png)

## Database and Functions &nbsp; <img src="./resources/database-storage.png" height="30" align="justify"/>

- Install the [appwrite cli](https://appwrite.io/docs/command-line)
- Open a directory and login to appwrite cli in a terminal or cmd
```
appwrite login
```
- Enter credentails used for signing up - Leave host as default unless you know what you are doing
- Download this script for [windows](./resources/create.cmd) or for [linux](./resources/create.sh)
- Run the script with following arguments
For Linux
```
./create.sh yourProjectID yourProjectName yourHost yourAPIKey
```
For Windows
```
./create.cmd yourProjectID yourProjectName yourHost yourAPIKey
```
- This will create an appwrte.json in your directory
- Now Download this [functions.zip](./resources/functions.zip) and extract in the same directory
- Run the follwing command
```
appwrite deploy --all
```
- Select all `a` and `enter` then again select all `a` and `enter`
- This will setup everything for you

# Known Bug &nbsp; <img src="./resources/bug.png" height="30" align="justify"/>

- The above command `appwrite deploy -all` might fail while deploying functions and give you an error `Unexpected token`
- If that's the case then you will have to create functions manually
- Open appwrite in browser `localhost:80` and go to functions
- You have to add three new functions with following ids:
```
1. createMessageCollection
2. createUserDocument
3. notifyUser
```
For all three of these you have to add these variables in the settings

For `createMessageCollection` and `notifyUser` add this in Execute access section:
```
role:member
```

and For `createUserDocument` check the account.create event

- Now run these [commands](./resources/commands.txt) one by one in the same directory where you have the appwrite.json and functions
- After this all your functions will be deployed

## Usage &nbsp; <img src="./resources/smartphone.png" height="30" align="justify"/>
